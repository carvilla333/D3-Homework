It includes a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. We coded this graphic in the app.js file of the homework directory with the data pulled from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Additionally, we Included state abbreviations in the circles, and we created and situated the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
